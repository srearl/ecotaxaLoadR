#' @title Annotate EcoTaxa records as day or night based on ship position, and
#'   collection date and time.
#'
#' @description \code{annotate_daytime} annotates whether a given
#'   observation in an EcoTaxa record was collected during the day or night
#'   based on ship position, and collection date and time. The function assumes
#'   that the collection time is provided in UTC. Minimal processing of the
#'   EcoTaxa file such that cruise and MOC ids are included as separate columns
#'   in the data frame as `cruise` and `moc`, respectively, is required.
#'
#' @note The function was parallelized as the initial implementation computed
#'   `is_day` for each record of the data frame. Since all MOCs do (or should)
#'   have the same collection details, the function was refactored to group the
#'   records by cruise and MOC, and computes `is_day` for each group, which are
#'   then joined to the full data set. This reduces the number of calls to
#'   `is_daytime` and speeds up the computation, but it is still computationally
#'   expensive and, thus, the parallelization was retained.
#'
#' @param eco_taxa_df (character) Unquoted name of data downloaded from EcoTaxa
#'   to the R environment at least minimally processed to have separate columns
#'   for the cruise and MOC ids as `cruise` and `moc`, respectively.
#' @param workers (integer) The number of parallel workers to use. Defaults to
#'   one less than the available cores.
#'
#' @return A data frame with an additional column `is_day` indicating whether
#'   the observation occurred during daytime.
